Global Execution Context :
	The global execution context is the top-level context in a JavaScript program. It represents the global scope, encompassing the entire program and all its components. 
	This context sets the stage for the entire code execution process and plays a pivotal role in managing global variables and functions.

Memory:
	a=undefined()
	hello()
	{
	}

Code:
	console.log(a)
	hello();

Variables & functions() are hosted in Java Script

Undefined -> Preserved word

Temporial Dead Zone: 
	Concept in Java Script that relates to the hoisting of the variables & visibility of variables declared with let & const.
	In Temporial Dead Zone, a variable exists but it cannot be access until it is not declared.

Hosting: 
	Declaration of functions, variables, closes to the TOP of their scope, prior to execution of code.


The let & const keywords:
	Variables defined with let & const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
	Using a "let" variable before it is declared will result in a "Reference Error".
	Using a "const" variable before it is declared is a "Syntax Error".
